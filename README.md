# Swing-It-
Submitted for LA Hacks 2019.

### Inspiration
There was a student talked about that he had a cool dream. In his dream, he swing around like Spider-Man.

### What it does
It is a First-Person game. Player can swing around like a Spider-Man. There are three levels. Player need to complete different mission in each one of them.

### How We built it
We used Unity and C#.

### Challenges We ran into
We had two major problems. First, we had trouble of implementing mechanical movement. Seoncd, we had trouble of adding more functionalities. We used a different way to achieve the swaing motion, which made the whole project hard to add more features .  

### Accomplishments that We're proud of
We are proud that our player can actually swing through the level.

### What We learned
We learned a lot 3D from Unity.

### What's next for TypeTypeRevolution
We want to reimplement the swing motion part. We also want to restructure the project design and add more levels.
